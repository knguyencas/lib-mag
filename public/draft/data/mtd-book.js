Is it not just, he reasons, for a man of genius to transgress moral law if it will ultimately benefit humanity? So begins one of the greatest novels ever written: a powerful psychological study, a terrifying murder mystery, and a haunting exploration of morality and redemption. Raskolnikov, an impoverished student living in a garret in the gloomy slums of St. Petersburg, carries out his grotesque scheme and plunges into a hell of guilt, paranoia, and madness. As he grapples with his conscience, Dostoevsky lays bare the dark recesses of the criminal mind — the fragile balance between pride and despair, and the eternal struggle between good and evil within the human soul.",

When the depraved patriarch Fyodor Karamazov is murdered, suspicion falls on his three sons — the sensual Dmitri, the intellectual Ivan, and the spiritual Alyosha. As the brothers wrestle with questions of justice, sin, and the existence of God, Dostoevsky reveals the depths of human consciousness in all its contradictions. A sweeping epic of family conflict and spiritual crisis, *The Brothers Karamazov* explores man’s search for meaning in a world haunted by doubt, freedom, and divine silence. It is both a detective story of the soul and a masterpiece of psychological insight that shaped modern thought.",

With biting wit and haunting honesty, Sylvia Plath captures the claustrophobic pressure of a young woman suffocating under perfection and the weight of her own thoughts. A piercing portrayal of mental illness and female consciousness, this semi-autobiographical novel remains one of the most powerful portraits of psychological breakdown ever written.",

Blending autobiography, myth, and psychological insight, *Memories, Dreams, Reflections* reads like an exploration of the soul’s secret geography. It is both confession and map — the record of a man who dared to look within and found the infinite reflected there.",

Meanwhile, Nakata, an aging simple man who talks to cats, embarks on a mysterious mission that defies logic. Their parallel journeys blur the line between dreams and reality, drawing them into a world where time dissolves and the unconscious speaks. Through eerie coincidences and haunting beauty, Murakami crafts a vast, hypnotic exploration of trauma, identity, and the invisible forces that bind us. *Kafka on the Shore* is not simply read—it is entered, like a dream you cannot forget.",

The ego stands between primal instinct and moral conscience, negotiating the demands of both. Through these unseen struggles, personality takes shape—and sometimes fractures. *The Ego and the Id* lays the groundwork for modern psychology’s understanding of repression, guilt, and identity. It remains a concise yet revolutionary map of the forces that move every human being from within.",

Elegant and humane, Aristotle’s ethics remains one of the most practical guides to moral character ever written.",

It challenges readers to see liberation not as privilege, but as the right to define one’s own existence.",

Both terrifying and brilliant, *Leviathan* reveals the psychology of authority and obedience, the origins of law, and the eternal trade between security and freedom.",

    "blurb": "In one of the first true autobiographies ever written, Augustine tells the story of his restless search for truth—from sensuality and ambition to conversion and peace. But *Confessions* is more than memory; it is an intimate dialogue between man and God, self and conscience. Augustine’s honesty about weakness and wonder about grace laid the foundation for Western introspection. It remains a mirror for every soul seeking meaning in a world of distraction.",

Dense but revolutionary, *Ideas* is a map back to the immediacy of being.",
